## Presentation
<p>
Teller is a mini social network for its members to be friends with other members, to create posting groups and articles within those groups. Each administrator in a group can authorize or not allow specific members of the group to be able to post, comment or only view articles.
</p>
<p>
The backend of this site was made in PHP / MYSQL, according to an MVC architecture. The front-end is done only with Jquery. It is possible to create articles and comments via an editor based on TinyMCE.
</p>
<p>
This project is an initiative resulting from my validation of knowledge carried out on Openclassrooms in 2018.
</p>

Realized in July 2018.
